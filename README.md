MuSIC: Multi-Scale Image Classifier (A general-purpose deep neural framework for image classification)

A general-purpose Multi-Scale Image Classifier, named as MuSIC, is designed for script classification. MuSIC is an end-to-end multi-CNN parallel framework which consists of three main modules â€“ (i) multi-scale CNN based prediction, (ii) a novel scale-wise weight computation module, and (iii) weight-aware decision for final prediction.
